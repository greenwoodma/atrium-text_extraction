    Specifically it extracts the text from a PDF one page at a time, storing
    the text into a single string and recording offset information about certain
    section types. Currently the sections are page, body, and end_matter.
    Args:
        file: A File object or an object that supports the standard read
              and seek methods similar to a File object. Could also be a
              string representing a path to a PDF file.
